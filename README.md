I am a passionate programming student with a strong interest in automation and problem solving. I'm committed to expanding my technical skills and exploring new areas of software development. 

I have experience working on projects in C++ and Python, which allowed me to explore the potential of software technologies. Recently, I began working with Linux, appreciating its flexibility and power for programming and automation tasks that, in the future plan to use for hosting a home server.

Currently, I am diving into Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), drawn by the structure and principles that make this approach so effective for building robust applications. 

I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on projects where I can further develop my skills and make meaningful contributions. Looking ahead, I aspire to work on complex, impactful projects that challenge me to grow as a developer.

I am also passionate in mainly FDM 3D printing but also interested in resin and metal 3D printing.
